Canary checker is a kubernetes-native platform for monitoring health across application and infrastructure using both passive and active (synthetic) mechanisms.

## Features

* **Batteries Included** - 35+ built-in check types
* **Kubernetes Native** - Health checks (or canaries) are CRD's that reflect health via the `status` field, making them compatible with GitOps, [Flux Health Checks](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#health-checks), Argo, Helm, etc..
* **Secret Management** - Leverage K8S secrets and configmaps for authentication and connection details
* **Prometheus** - Prometheus compatible metrics are exposed at `/metrics`.  A Grafana Dashboard is also available.
* **Dependency Free** - Runs an embedded postgres instance by default,  can also be configured to use an external database.
* **JUnit Export (CI/CD)**  - Export health check results to JUnit format for integration into CI/CD pipelines
* **JUnit Import (k6/newman/puppeter/etc)** - Use any container that creates JUnit test results
* **Scriptable** - Go templates, Javascript and [CEL](https://canarychecker.io/scripting/cel) can be used to:
  * Evaluate whether a check is passing and severity to use when failing
  * Extract a user friendly error message
  * Transform and filter check responses into individual check results
  * Extract custom metrics
* **Multi-Modal** - While designed as a Kubernetes Operator, canary checker can also run as a CLI and a server without K8s

## Getting Started

1. Install canary checker with Helm

```shell
helm repo add flanksource https://flanksource.github.io/charts
helm repo update

helm install \
  canary-checker \
  flanksource/canary-checker \
 -n canary-checker \
 --create-namespace
 --wait
  ```

2. Create a new check

  ```yaml title="canary.yaml"
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: http-check
spec:
  interval: 30
  http:
    - name: basic-check
      url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/status/200
    - name: failing-check
      url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/status/500
  ```

2a. Run the check locally (Optional)

```shell
wget  https://github.com/flanksource/canary-checker/releases/latest/download/canary-checker_linux_amd64 \
-O canary-checker &&  chmod +x canary-checker
./canary-checker run canary.yaml
```

3. Apply the check

```shell
kubectl apply -f canary.yaml
```

4. Check the health status

```shell
kubectl get canary
```

``` title="sample output"
NAME               INTERVAL   STATUS   LAST CHECK   UPTIME 1H        LATENCY 1H   LAST TRANSITIONED
http-check.        30         Passed   13s          18/18 (100.0%)   480ms        13s
```

See [fixtures](https://github.com/flanksource/canary-checker/tree/master/fixtures) for more examples and [docs](https://canarychecker.io/getting-started) for more comprehensive documentation.

## Use Cases

### Synthetic Testing

Run simple HTTP/DNS/ICMP probes or more advanced full test suites using JMeter, K6, Playright, Postman.

```yaml
# Run a container that executes a playwright test, and then collect the
# JUnit formatted test results from the /tmp folder
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: playwright-junit
spec:
  interval: 120
  junit:
    - testResults: "/tmp/"
      name: playwright-junit
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: playwright
            image: ghcr.io/flanksource/canary-playwright:latest
```

### Infrastructure Testing

Verify that infrastructure is fully operational by [deploying new pods](https://canarychecker.io/reference/pod), spinning up new EC2 instances and pushing/pulling from docker and helm repositories.

```yaml
# Schedule a new pod with an ingress and then time how long it takes to schedule, be ready, respond to an http request and finally be cleaned up.
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: pod-check
spec:
  interval: 30
  pod:
    - name: golang
      spec: |
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: hello-world-golang
          namespace: default
          labels:
            app: hello-world-golang
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello
              image: quay.io/toni0/hello-webserver-golang:latest
      port: 8080
      path: /foo/bar
      scheduleTimeout: 20000
      readyTimeout: 10000
      httpTimeout: 7000
      deleteTimeout: 12000
      ingressTimeout: 10000
      deadline: 60000
      httpRetryInterval: 200
      expectedContent: bar
      expectedHttpStatuses: [200, 201, 202]
```

### Backup Checks / Batch File Monitoring

Check that batch file processes are functioning correctly by checking the age and size of files in local file systems, SFTP, SMB, S3 and GCS.

```yaml
# Checks that a recent DB backup has been uploaded
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: folder-check
spec:
  schedule: 0 22 * * *
  folder:
    - path: s3://database-backups/prod
      name: prod-backup
      maxAge: 1d
      minSize: 10gb
```

### Alert Aggregation

Aggregate alerts and recommendations from Prometheus, AWS Cloudwatch, Dynatrace, etc.

```yaml
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: alertmanager-check
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  alertmanager:
    - url: alertmanager.monitoring.svc
      alerts:
        - .*
      ignore:
        - KubeScheduler.*
        - Watchdog
      transform:
        # for each alert, transform it into a new check
        javascript: |
          var out = _.map(results, function(r) {
            return {
              name: r.name,
              labels: r.labels,
              icon: 'alert',
              message: r.message,
              description: r.message,
            }
          })
          JSON.stringify(out);
```

### Prometheus Exporter Replacement

Export [custom metrics](https://canarychecker.io/concepts/metrics-exporter) from the result of any check, making it possible to replace various other promethus exporters that collect metrics via HTTP, SQL, etc..

```yaml
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: exchange-rates
spec:
  schedule: "every 1 @hour"
  http:
    - name: exchange-rates
      url: https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?from=USD&to=GBP,EUR,ILS
      metrics:
        - name: exchange_rate
          type: gauge
          value: result.json.rates.GBP
          labels:
            - name: "from"
              value: "USD"
            - name: to
              value: GBP
```

## Platform Ready

Canary checker is ideal for building platforms, developers can include health checks for their applications in whatever tooling they prefer, with secret management that uses native Kubernetes constructs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name:  basic-auth
stringData:
   user: john
   pass: doe
---
apiVersion: canaries.flanksource.com/v1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: http-basic-auth-configmap
spec:
  http:
    - url: https://httpbin.demo.aws.flanksource.com/basic-auth/john/doe
      username:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: basic-auth
            key: user
      password:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: basic-auth
            key: pass
```

## Dashboard

Canary checker comes with a built-in dashboard by default

![](https://canarychecker.io/img/canary-ui.png)

There is also a [grafana](https://canarychecker.io/concepts/grafana) dashboard, or build your own using the metrics exposed.
